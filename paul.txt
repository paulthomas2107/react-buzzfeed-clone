Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'components/Title' in '/Users/paulthomas/react-buzzfeed-clone/src'
Did you mean './components/Title'?
Requests that should resolve in the current directory need to start with './'.
Requests that start with a name are treated as module requests and resolve within module directories (node_modules, /Users/paulthomas/react-buzzfeed-clone/node_modules).
If changing the source code is not an option there is also a resolve options called 'preferRelative' which tries to resolve these kind of requests in the current directory too.
